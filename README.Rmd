The goal of Experiment Calculator is to provide a simple calculator to plan, analyse and diagnose simple experiments.

## Use shinyapps.io

This package allows you to run the app locally. If you don't want to run the dashboard locally, then the calculator is also available on shinyapps.io here (https://stephen-bush.shinyapps.io/ExperimentCalculator/)

## Installation

You can install the development version of ExperimentCalculator like so:

```{r install, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='hide'}
devtools::install_github('sabush/ExperimentCalculator')

```

## Load the Calculator

To load the power and significance calculator, load the library and run the app

```{r example}
library(ExperimentCalculator)
#ExperimentCalculator::run_app() # Uncomment to run the app
```

Further usage of the app can be found in the vignettes.
